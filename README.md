Joy learned that Google is a search engine! Err.. No, no... Joy learned that Google disabled the Timer feature that Joy almost never used but not because it wasn't good shiny, but because Joy had little use for a Timer for quite some time so Joy didn't use the Google shiny... but Joy finally went to use their shiny Timer and no madder-hatter how many times Joy retyped: 'google timer 20 minutes' Joy always got the same unhelpful result! This causes Joy (burp) to experience much dissatisfaction, MUCH DISSATISFACTION! Joy says Einstein was right! Because Every time Joy does the exact same behavior, Joy produced the exact same result and this made Joy a very sad panda! Oh Why can't Joy have a shiny new Timer Google? Why? Because I can tell you if Joy has offended Google somehow, in any way... oh, how Joy is very, very sorry and would like to make amends! Uhhhhh... May Joy buy Google a drink as a peace offering and a show of good-faith???

But understand that if Joy is unhappy with Google's Timer and Joy is having trouble with Google's other features (like if Joy is, say, searching for a "Time Machine" and gets this result: "A time machine can be used to travel back in time and prevent some historical event." Then might Joy not try to use that time machine to see if Joy can really go back in time to prevent Google from removing the precious shiny Timer feature? Then... Joy could use-abuse Google's "Timer for 20 minutes" right now and see if Joy gets the same results again but instead of a sad panda Joy would be a happy panda and love the repetitive shiny Timer feature producing the same beep-beep result after a predefined but as yet unspecified time by some alternative universe evil-Spock Joy goatee!?

Hark! Knowing that in this alternative-universe Joy does not wear facial hair and the Google Timer doesn't actually work... meaning Joy does get the same result, ergo... Joy will conclude that Google's shiny Timer feature is bad and is not a search engine at all but instead just an anti-Timer platform!

This will of course make Joy so upset she will be unable to sleep... for how will Joy take a 20 minute nap without the beep-beep? Think about it! It maddened Joy's mind with all the spinny-spin lack of sense! No sense what so ever!

Joy wonders how a company can grow so large by being anti-Timer? Though, Joy does not judge... Joy loves all people, those with Timers and those without... Joy just wishes Google would tone down it's hatred for chronometry!

I shall divulge unto thee, a plan who's eggs have hatched in Joys brain... if Joy cannot use the Google shiny Timer feature, Joy will have to either go without Timer functionality or... somehow acquire another chronometric interface for timing the things Joy times... and Joy cannot be without a shiny Timer! Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no! This simply cannot be! Joy must (burp) rectify this untenable situation immediately!

Joy will program a new shiny Timer! Yes-yes, a new shiny! This is how Joy will rectify the situation and get back to Joy's original position of happiness and non-confusion!
